# war

There are 2 players, and 52 cards (jokers excluded).
After shuffling, each player starts the game with 26 cards.
Every time, each player draws a card, the higher card's owner takes both cards.
If cards are equal, war is declared. Each player draws 3 cards faced down, and 4th card face up.
Whoever has the highest 4th card takes them all.
If 4th cards are also equal, the cycle repeats until there is a winner. 
The game restarts from the beginning if no card is left on each player's hand to draw.
During the war, if any player fails to draw fewer cards than the opponent, he automatically loses.
